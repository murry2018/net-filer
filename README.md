# Net Filer

open fileserver on local network

*This project is in development.*

## goal

- server should be easy to launch, and easy to configure.
- server&client interface should be simple, and easy to use.

## non-goal

- access control & secure transfer(it is not recommended to transfer file over public network)
- numerous auxiliary commands(only ls, get, put!)
